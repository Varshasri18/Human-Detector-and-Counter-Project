# Human Detector and Counter

A mini project developed using Python and OpenCV to detect and count humans from live camera feeds, video files, or static images. Built as part of our B.E. Computer Science curriculum at MVJ College of Engineering, this project addresses automation in public transport for enhanced security and operational efficiency.

## Overview

This system simulates a smart passenger validation setup for train compartments. It automates entry detection using visual input, and can alert staff in case of mismatches, helping prevent unauthorized access and delays.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Argparse  
- Imutils

## Key Features

- Real-time person detection via webcam  
- Supports input from videos and images  
- Displays live bounding boxes and person count  
- Easy CLI interface and modular design  
- Simulated alert system for mismatches

## Future Scope

- Facial recognition for ticket validation  
- Integration with QR/barcode/RFID systems  
- Biometric authentication  
- Dashboard for real-time monitoring
